          <h1>SUMMARY</h1>
          <p>I gained my first programming experience at school when I wanted to develop my own game mod for the one online game.
          To do this, I downloaded a ready-made open source game mod, and then read and delved into its code to write my own.
          First javascript development experience was obtained about six months ago when I needed to make two auto-clickers.
          One for Google forms and one more to copy all my songs from the music directory of VK into one of my conversations.
          The experience of Java was obtained in the development of lab works at the university.
          <br><br>When developing, I prefer to look for ready-made effective solutions to avoid the invention of inefficient bicycles
          and try to write code so that other developers can easily underastand it.
          Right now I plan to deepen my knowledge in javascript,
          HTML and CSS and I want to learn the basics of react.
          I chose programming because it is a job that I can do for a long time.
